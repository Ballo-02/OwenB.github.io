			<h1>I am an enthusiastic graduate, with a 1st Class Honours degree in Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security at Coventry Univeristy. I actively participate in cyber security events such as the CTF events, hacking groups/talks from guest speakers (sometimes through the Computer Security Society) to practise and understand more about hacking. Taking a placement year to penetration test Hypercars and Supercars has given me a vast knowledge in the cyber security automotive world. I am particularly proud of my hacking into IoT project where me and my team won a prize by following the penetration process of researching the infrastructure of the whiteboard devices in classrooms and gaining full root/administrator access. I am hardworking, honest, dependable, and self-motivated, clearly demonstrated by my project completion successes.</h1>
