												<h2>Full RCE VIA Kramer (IoT Devcies) box</h2>
												<p>Coventry University Showcase Event</p>
											</header>
											<p>A project intended for the Coventry University Talent Showcase event where we hacked into IoT (Internet of Things) e.g. the whiteboard. We managed to get full RCE without admintstrator priveladge for the kramer Go (debain) and the same for the windows version but pre-exisitng user needed with password. I also added an additional script to change the background photo and room information such as code and name.</p>

											</header>
											<p>This project transmits 2 FM signals and 2 DAB signals (clearly) on a chosen frequency/ensemble, station name and any extra details that can be added, using HackRF One devices. It runs on 1 python3 script with 4 HackRF&#x27;s plugged in at once running on Linux (Ubuntu used). You can choose if you want what you want running e.g doesn&#x27;t have to be all 4.</p>

												<h2>Controller &amp; Client Scripts</h2>
												<p>Coventry Univeristy- but will be adapted for everyday use</p>
											</header>
											<p>A project intended for my 2nd year Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security degree which involves a client (can be multiple scripts each on different machines) and a controller that will control these client scripts. You can send live commands to each client, relay a command (send a command from one client to the next), send python commands and send general useful commands used for enumerating a machine. This can all be selected from the GUI (Graphical User Interface) menu when the script is run.</p>

												<h2>Implemented a Website with a Secure Database</h2>
												<p>Coventry University</p>
											</header>
											<p>For one of my modules at Coventry University (Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security) I had to learn PHP, SQL, JavaScript, Html, CSS to create a website of my choose with a secure backend. I added a secure login with PHP session management that logged password securely in a database and had a leaderboard that interacted with the website score sheet. This also included different levels of access such as administrator.</p>

											<p>Research into Automotive Hacking for the ComSec (Computer Science) society with a PowerPoint presentation and simulator to show these attacks in action. This includes but not limited to capturing CAN (Controller Area Network) packets and relaying them to a car. This can be done by finding the ID for reving a cars engine by monitoring the cars packets via wireshark or specified scripts and seeing the rev counter increase then capturing this output. The captured output(rev packets) are then re-sent showing the car to rev, turn, signal ect.</p>

As a first-year project, I created a script using my knowledge of Python 3 and Linux, that when chosen could enumerate different operating systems and give a specific output depending on what was selected. This then chose which possible privilege escalation methods were available to use and adopt the appropriate function that would execute them.</p>

											<h2>So what's this all about?</h2>
											<p>This is <strong>Me</strong> showcasing my projects to potential employers and like minded peopel who're interested in cyber secuirty or similar fields</a>.</p>
											<p>I've always enjoyed reading other people articles or videos and thought it's a brillaint way to keep track of your progress and help others who're trying to achieve similair goals.
												I also made this website to go back to previous topics as no one can remember everything they've done and continue to do more resarch or re-learn a skill if it's been a while
